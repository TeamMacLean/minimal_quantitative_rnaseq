## About this chapter

1. Questions
  - How do I calculate counts of reads at genes from my alignments?
2. Objectives
  - Understand the basis for the gene region and read counting technique
  - Understand what the count matrix represents
  - Use the `make_counts()` function to make a count matrix
3. Keypoints
  - Gene regions are designated by coordinates in GFF files
  - A count matrix is a table-like object of reads that are found in a given genomic region

In this chapter we'll look at the fundamentals of read counting from a BAM file of aligned reads.

## Counting the number of reads that have aligned to gene regions

The basis of quantitative RNAseq is working out how many of our sequence reads have aligned to each gene. In broad terms this is done by taking the genomic coordinates of all the aligned reads (the start and end positions of the read's alignment on the reference genome) and cross-referencing them with the positions of the genes from a gene file. The resulting table is called a count matrix. See the figure below for a representation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A) Graphic of read alignment and gene position showing reads within genes. B) The equivalent count matrix that comes from this alignment"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/align.png", )
```

It is our aim in this section to create a count matrix from BAM files.

### atacR

`atacR` was initially designed to help with the analysis of ATAC-Cap-seq data, a quite differen sort of data to RNAseq, but as with many bioinformatics pipelines, the first steps are quite common so we can make use of the neat way `atacR` handles the count matrix creation in the helpful function `make_counts()` 

## Preparing the input

We needs three things to work: the BAM files, a GFF file and a file of sample information.

### The GFF file

GFF files are one way among many of describing the positions of genes on a genome. Here's a quick look at one.

```
chr123  .  gene  1300  1500  .  +  .  ID=gene1
chr123  .  gene  1050  1500  .  +  .  ID=gene2

```

As you can see, it's a simple file with a gene represented on each line, by its chromosome (`chr123`), its start and end and its strand. The best thing about GFF files is that usually we can just download them from the relevant genome website. They tend to be freely available.

### The Sample Information file

This file is a really simple file that references the BAM file of the alignment with the sample and replicate information. It has three columns: `sample_name`, `bam_file_path` and `treatment`. 
Here is an example.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table <- readr::read_csv("sample_data/sample_information.csv")
knitr::kable(table)
```

The `sample_name` column describes the treatment and replicate performed, the `bam_file_path` describes the place in which the BAM file for that sample is saved and `treatment` is the general name for the treatment that was used; this column is usually not unique when you have replicates.

### The BAM files

The BAM files all come from a previously done alignment. The sample information file describes the place where they are kept and the sample they represent.

### Sample files for this chapter

All the files are provided for you in the sample data you downloaded as `50_genes.gff` and `sample_information.csv` and in the folders containing BAM files. Feel free to examine them and look at how they relate to each other.

Once we have these files prepared, we can go on to use the `atacR` package to make the count matrix.

## Running `make_counts()`

First we must load in `atacR`. Type the following into the R console.

```{r}
library(atacr)
```

Now we can do the counting with `make_counts()`. Here's how to do it. Remember to properly describe the path to the files. The paths given here are correct if the files are in a folder called `sample_data` in the current working directory.  

```{r}
count_information <- make_counts("sample_data/50_genes.gff",
                                 "sample_data/sample_information.csv",
                                 is_rnaseq = TRUE
                                 )


```

The function should run and give no output. Note that it is important to set `is_rnaseq` to `TRUE` to tell the function to count appropriately. The results are saved in the `count_information` object.


## Summaries and Diagnostic plots

With the counts computed we can do some diagnosis on the quality of the experiment.

We can see summary information with the `summary()` function

```{r}
summary(count_information)
```

It is long, but actually quite helpful. The first thing to note is that the words relate to ATAC-Cap-Seq, but in our context 'bait regions' just mean gene regions and non-bait just means intergenic regions. The 'on_targets' are read hits to genes, the 'off_targets' are read hits to intergenic regions. 

We can see that all the reads have hit in gene regions; that the read depth distribution of genes from the quantiles section give depths in the 1000 - 2000 range. This sort of summary is helpful when you're trying to work out whether the RNAseq is useful, lots of reads 'off target' is bad, as is low depth.

### Gene Count Plots

We can see the distribution of depths over genes as a plot using the `plot_counts()` function

```{r}
plot_counts(count_information, log10 = FALSE)
```

We can see that the mean count per gene (windows in `atacR`) is about 1000. The distributions in the treatment are  bit more skewed than the controls.  

### Comparing Samples with PCA

It is common to examine the similarity of the samples to each other before moving on with analysis, ideally the similar samples will cluster together.

With `atacR` it is easy to perform a quick PCA analysis.

```{r}
sample_pca_plot(count_information)
```

Here we can see that the control samples all cluster together, but the treatment samples are a bit more variable. We might want to normalise these counts later as a consequence.

## Extracting and saving the count matrix

We now want to extract out the actual counts hiding inside the `count_information` object, we can do this with the `assay()` extractor function from the `Summarized Experiment` package.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
raw_counts <- assay(count_information$bait_windows)

head(raw_counts)
  
```

We can see the counts for each gene in each sample. Because `atacR` works on windows, the gene coordinates are given. We can replace the coordinates with gene names if we wish as follows

```{r}
gene_names <- readr::read_csv("sample_data/gene_names.txt", col_names = FALSE )$X1

rownames(raw_counts) <- gene_names
head(raw_counts)

```

In this code chunk we load in the gene names from a file `gene_names.txt` using the `readr` package. Then we use the `rownames()` function to set the row names of `raw_counts`. This _is_ a little cumbersome. Often you'll come across fiddly little things like this in bioinformatics analysis. If you ever get stuck feel free to come and chat to us in the bioinformatics team.

Now we can save the matrix to a file for re-use and importing into other programs. We'll do it in two ways 1) to a native R binary file that we can load straight in, 2) to a CSV file we can examine in programs including Excel.

### Saving to an R RDS file

To save as a native R object, use `saveRDS()`, passing the filename you wish to save to.

```{r}
saveRDS(raw_counts, "sample_data/raw_counts.RDS")
```

To save as a csv file use `write.table()`, again passing the filename you wish to save to.

```{r}
write.csv( raw_counts, "sample_data/raw_counts.csv")
```

Now we can move on to using `DESeq`.
